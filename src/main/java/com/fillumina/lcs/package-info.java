/**
 * This project has two distinct goals:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create an usable and fast implementation of the LCS algorithm;
 * <li>presents some LCS implemetations that can be easily compared and
 * studied.
 * <ul>
 * The only published content is the fast implementation while the test
 * packages contain a lot of different LCS implementations that share the same
 * interface and can be compared with various tests.
